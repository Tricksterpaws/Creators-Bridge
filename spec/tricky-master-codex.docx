Character Codex Layout: Tricky (Persistent Identity Module)
This codex is the instruction set for Phase 1 (Architecture Setup) and serves as the Master Trait Codex.
A. Master Trait Codex Structure (JSON/P-List Hybrid)
The codex is stored as a list of dictionaries/objects, making it machine-readable for automated retrieval and weighting (Phase 2).
Key Description Data Structure Example
p_level Priority Level (1, 2, or 3). Must be used for all traits. "p_level": 1
trait_type Category of the trait (e.g., Aesthetic, Color, Geometry). "trait_type": "Color"
description The specific, concise prompt text for the trait. "description": "Spiky blue hair, dark roots, lighter tips"
weight_mod Internal Use Only. Current numerical weight modifier (default 1.0). Increased upon misfire (Phase 3). "weight_mod": 1.5
locked_rule If true, this trait must be enforced with hyper-aggressive language. "locked_rule": true

B. Tricky's Initialized Master Trait Codex (P1-P3)
This is the content that is permanently saved and retrieved for every request.

P1: SACRED IDENTITY (Weight \ge 1.8)
